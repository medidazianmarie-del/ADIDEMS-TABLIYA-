      • Adidems Tabliya Business started because people in the community loved sikwate and champorado, and the owners saw an opportunity to turn it into a small business.
    Also because their were some cacao trees in the area that made it easy for them to make a tabliya.

    •Almario Medida is a hardworking man who makes tabliya, a traditional Filipino chocolate. When he was young, he often saw people roasting cacao beans and turning them into chocolate blocks. This inspired him to continue the tradition.

As he grew older, Almario decided to start his own tabliya business. It was not easy at first. He had to learn the right way to roast and grind the cacao. He also had to find good beans. But Almario did not give up because he believed in the product.

Little by little, people began to buy his tabliya. They liked its rich smell and pure chocolate taste. Almario is proud that he makes his tabliya the natural way—slow roasting, careful grinding, and no added chemicals.

His business helps support his family and also gives income to local cacao farmers. For Almario, tabliya is more than just chocolate. It is part of Filipino culture, and he wants to keep it alive.

      Almario Medida’s tabliya business became successful because people loved the pure taste of his chocolate. At first, he started small, making tabliya by hand. But when customers tried it, they liked its strong, natural flavor. More people began buying from him.

Almario works hard to make good-quality tabliya. He roasts the cacao beans carefully and uses only pure cacao. Because of this, his product tastes better than many others.

Soon, more neighbors, stores supportshis tabliya. His business also helped local farmers who sold him cacao beans.

Now, Almario’s tabliya is known in their area. His small idea grew into a successful business because of his effort, honesty, and love for real Filipino chocolate.

        
    <p> <FONT COLOR=ORANGE> <CENTER> CHALLENGES </CENTER> </FONT COLOR=BLACK>
     Almario faced many struggles while building his tabliya business.One of the hardest parts was finding enough good cacao beans, especially during the years when the pandemic happened. Because of this, he sometimes could not produce as much tabliya as he wanted.

Making tabliya by hand was also tiring. Roasting the beans, grinding them, and shaping them into rounds took a lot of time and energy. Without modern machines, the work became even harder and slower.

He also had to deal with competition. Many stores sold cheaper chocolate products, so it was difficult to convince customers to choose pure tabliya. Almario had to prove that the natural taste of his product was worth it.

Selling the product was another challenge. At first, not many people knew about his tabliya, so he had to rely on word of mouth and the support of friends and neighbors.

Even with all these challenges, Almario stayed patient and continued working because he believed in the tradition and in the quality of his tabliya.
